 Passwords & Keys - History Files
 =================================
 
 THEORY FOR THIS ATTACK:
 
 If a user accidentally types their password on the command line instead of into a password prompt, it may get recorded in a history file.
 
 LAB:
 1.To view the contents of all the hidden history files in the users' home directory:
 
 cat ~/.*history | less
 
 2. Got a password which user tries to connect to mysql
 
 3. su root
