SUID SGIN EXECUTABLES  - Exploiting Shell Features
===================================================

/usr/local/bin/suid-env2 is identical to /usr/local/bin/suid-env except: IT USES THE ABSOLUTE PATH OF THE SERVICE EXECUTABLE 
(/usr/sbin/service) TO START THE APACHE2 WEBSERVER.

HOW TO EXPLOIT????

NOTE: in bash version <4.2-048 it is possible to define functions with names resembles to file paths. Then export those functions so that they are used
instead of actual executable at the file path.
